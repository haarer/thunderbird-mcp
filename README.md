Give your AI assistant read-only access to Thunderbird -- search mail, read messages, list calendars and contacts. All through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

> forked from [TKasperczyk/thunderbird-mcp](https://github.com/TKasperczyk/thunderbird-mcp). Removed all tools that could change the state of Thunderbird. Only reading tools remain.

---

## Why?

Thunderbird has no official API for AI tools. Your AI assistant can't read your email or manage your calendar. This extension fixes that -- it exposes 15 read-only tools over MCP so any compatible AI (OpenCode, Claude, GPT, local models) can read your mail the way you'd expect, without ever being able to modify it.


---

## How it works

```
                    stdio              HTTP (localhost:8765-8774)
  MCP Client  <----------->  Bridge  <--------------------->  Thunderbird
  (Claude, etc.)           mcp-bridge.cjs                    Extension + HTTP Server
```

The Thunderbird extension embeds a local HTTP server with session-scoped auth tokens. The Node.js bridge translates between MCP's stdio protocol and HTTP, discovering the port and token automatically via a connection file. The bridge handles MCP lifecycle methods (initialize, ping) locally, so clients can connect even before Thunderbird is fully loaded.

## What you can do

### Mail

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listAccounts` | List all email accounts and their identities |
| `listFolders` | Browse folder tree with message counts -- filter by account or subtree |
| `searchMessages` | Search by subject, sender, recipient, body preview, date range, or tags. Multi-word queries are AND-of-tokens (every word must appear somewhere). Prefix with `from:`, `subject:`, `to:`, or `cc:` to restrict to one field. Set `searchBody: true` for full-text body search via Thunderbird's Gloda index. Supports `includeSubfolders`, `countOnly`, and offset-based pagination. Results include `threadId` and `preview` snippet. By default, `dedupByMessageId` collapses the same RFC Message-ID found in multiple folders/labels into one row and reports the other folder paths in `dupLocations`; set `dedupByMessageId: false` to return every location. |
| `getMessage` | Read full email content -- `bodyFormat`: `markdown` (default), `text`, or `html`. Set `rawSource: true` for the complete RFC 2822 source (all headers + MIME parts). Optional attachment saving. Set `includeInlineImages: true` to append supported inline CID images as MCP image blocks (PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP; max 1 MiB base64 per image and 4 MiB total). Skipped images are reported in attachment metadata. |
| `getMessages` | Read full email content for up to the configured batch limit in one call (default 10, max 20). Uses the same `bodyFormat`, `rawSource`, and attachment options as `getMessage`; each item supplies `messageId` and `folderPath`. |
| `getRecentMessages` | Get recent messages with date, unread, and tag filtering. Supports pagination. Results include `threadId` and `preview`. |
| `displayMessage` | Open a message in Thunderbird's GUI -- `3pane` (default), `tab`, or `window` mode |

### Filters

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listFilters` | List all filter rules with human-readable conditions and actions |

### Contacts

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `searchContacts` | Search contacts across all address books by email or name and return full contact details. Supports `maxResults`. |
| `getContact` | Read full contact details by UID |

### Calendar

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listCalendars` | List all calendars with read-only, event, and task support flags |
| `listEvents` | Query events by date range with recurring event expansion. Returns `status` on each event. |
| `listCategories` | List all calendar categories |
| `listTasks` | List tasks/to-dos from calendars -- filter by completion status, due date, or calendar |

### Access Control

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `getAccountAccess` | View which accounts the MCP server can access |

Account and tool access are configured via the extension settings page (Tools > Add-ons > Thunderbird MCP > Options). Access control is not MCP-exposed -- only the user can change it.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install the extension

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haarer/thunderbird-mcp.git
```

Install `dist/thunderbird-mcp.xpi` in Thunderbird (Tools > Add-ons > Install from File), then restart. A pre-built XPI is included in the repo -- no build step needed.

**Automatic updates:** From v0.7.3 on, the add-on auto-updates through Thunderbird's add-on update check. Thunderbird downloads updates in the background and applies them on the next restart; because this add-on uses an experiment API, updates are not live hot-swapped. v0.7.3 is the last build you need to install by hand because older builds have no `update_url` and cannot auto-discover it. Thunderbird ships with `xpinstall.signatures.required=false`, so unsigned auto-updates work out of the box; a profile hardened to require signatures blocks both manual and automatic installs. If updates do not arrive, check the Add-ons gear menu and make sure **Update Add-ons Automatically** is enabled.

### 2. Configure your MCP client

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `~/.claude.json` for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thunderbird-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/thunderbird-mcp/mcp-bridge.cjs"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Sandbox-aware connection discovery

The bridge re-discovers `connection.json` on every cache miss. It tries these locations in order:

1. `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE`, if set
2. Native temp dir: `<os.tmpdir()>/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json`
3. macOS fallback: `/var/folders/*/*/T/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json` owned by the current user
4. Linux Snap: Thunderbird's live `TMPDIR` from `/proc/<pid>/environ`, plus the official snap fallback under `~/Downloads/thunderbird.tmp`
5. Linux Flatpak / Betterbird Flatpak: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/app/*/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json`

This covers native installs, the official Thunderbird snap, Thunderbird Flatpak, Thunderbird Beta Flatpak, and Betterbird Flatpak without changing the extension side. If multiple sandbox candidates exist at once, the bridge tries the newest file first. Set `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE` to force a single explicit path.

Example override:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thunderbird-mail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/thunderbird-mcp/mcp-bridge.cjs"],
      "env": {
        "THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE": "/absolute/path/to/connection.json"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Your AI can now access Thunderbird.

### `connection.json` format

The extension writes the server's connection details to `connection.json` on every startup (in the temp directory for your platform, see above). The bridge discovers and parses this file to find the HTTP server. Format:

```json
{
  "port": 8765,
  "token": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
  "pid": 12345,
  "host": "host.containers.internal"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `port` | number | The actual HTTP port the server bound to (one of 8765-8774) |
| `token` | string | Session-scoped bearer token (64 lowercase hex chars). Required for every HTTP request (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) |
| `pid` | number | Thunderbird's process ID. Informational only -- the bridge never reads it |
| `host` | string | Optional. Host the bridge should connect to instead of `127.0.0.1`. Used when the bridge runs in a container and Thunderbird is on the host (`host.containers.internal` for Podman/Docker, `host.docker.internal` for Docker Desktop on macOS/Windows) |

The bridge requires `port` and `token`; a file missing either is rejected with "missing port or token". The `host` field is optional -- the bridge falls back to `127.0.0.1` when absent. Host precedence: `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_HOST` env var (comma-separated list) > `connection.json` `host` field > `127.0.0.1`. A sample file is committed at `connection.json` in the repo root -- do not rename it over a real one (e.g. when setting `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE`) or the bridge will fail to authenticate. Note: the extension itself writes only `port`, `token`, and `pid`; add `host` to a copy of the file when you need the container-bridge scenario. Connecting from a container also requires enabling **Listen on all interfaces** in the extension settings (see Security), otherwise the server is bound to loopback on the host.

---

## Security

- **Auth tokens**: The HTTP server requires a session-scoped bearer token. Generated on startup, written to `<TmpD>/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json` with 0600 permissions. The bridge re-discovers that file automatically across native installs, Snap, Flatpak, Betterbird Flatpak, and macOS temp directories.
- **Dynamic port**: Tries ports 8765-8774, records the actual port in the connection file. No hardcoded port dependency.
- **Account access control**: Restrict which email accounts are visible to MCP clients via the settings page. Changes take effect immediately.
- **Tool access control**: Disable specific tools via the settings page. Disabled tools are hidden from `tools/list` and blocked at dispatch.
- **Localhost only**: By default, the server binds to localhost only. The "Listen on all interfaces" option in settings binds to all IPv4 interfaces for WSL, Docker, or remote access. **This exposes the MCP server to every device on your local network.** Only enable on trusted networks. Auth token is always required.
- **Auto-update integrity**: Auto-update is a code-delivery channel whose integrity depends on continued control of the GitHub repository and the GitHub Actions token.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Extension not loading | Check Tools > Add-ons and Themes. Errors: Tools > Developer Tools > Error Console |
| Connection refused | Make sure Thunderbird is running and the extension is enabled |
| Bridge in a container, Thunderbird on the host | Add `"host": "host.containers.internal"` to the connection file the bridge reads, and enable **Listen on all interfaces** in the extension settings |
| Bridge can't find `connection.json` | Set `THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE` explicitly if your environment uses a non-standard temp/runtime path |
| Missing recent emails | IMAP folders can be stale. Click the folder in Thunderbird to sync, or right-click > Properties > Repair Folder |
| Tool not found after update | Reconnect MCP (`/mcp` in Claude Code) to pick up new tools |
| `searchBody` returns no results | IMAP accounts need offline sync enabled for Gloda to index message bodies |
| `rawSource` fails on IMAP | Requires local/offline message copy. Enable offline sync or click the message first to cache it. |

---

## Development

```bash
# Build the extension
./scripts/build.sh

# Test via the bridge (handles auth automatically)
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | node mcp-bridge.cjs

# Test the HTTP API directly.
# On Snap / Flatpak / Betterbird Flatpak / macOS, point CONN_FILE at the
# real file or export THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE first.
CONN_FILE="${THUNDERBIRD_MCP_CONNECTION_FILE:-/tmp/thunderbird-mcp/connection.json}"
TOKEN=$(jq -r .token "$CONN_FILE")
PORT=$(jq -r .port "$CONN_FILE")
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:$PORT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

**Dev-only extension reload:** After changing extension source locally, remove the add-on from Thunderbird, restart, reinstall the XPI, and restart again. Thunderbird caches aggressively. Regular users should install v0.7.3 once and let auto-update handle later releases.

## Known issues

- IMAP folder databases can be stale until you click on them in Thunderbird
- HTML-only emails are converted to plain text (original formatting is lost)
- Pre-existing Thunderbird filters with cross-account move/copy targets are not restricted by account access control
- `searchBody` on IMAP without offline sync only searches headers (Gloda limitation)
- `rawSource` requires offline message copy for IMAP -- online-only messages will error
